# Demo Electron

A working Nuxt Electron project with minimal configuration, demonstrating how to integrate Nuxt.js with Electron for desktop application development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project and navigate to its directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development mode: `npm run dev`
4. Build the project: `npm run build` - The executable will be generated at `/dist/win-unpacked/<app-name>.exe`

## Configuration Warning

Before changing configurations, note that most will work in dev mode. Production mode breaks easily, ensure to test the executable file before committing configuration changes.

## Known Issues

- Can't run the latest Nuxt version (tested with `Nuxt 3.13.1`)
